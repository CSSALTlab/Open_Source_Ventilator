# VentSim
The VentSim purpose is to focus on UI and high level control of the Ventilator. Some particular files will be port to the real Ventilator project and others emulates the native Arduino libraries.

## Project concept
The goal of the Ventilator project is to provide ways to anyone produce a ventilator using low cost out-of-shelf components.

### Some suggested components:

* Microcontroller (US$12)

## Controller
At this point the team building the Ventilator only needs a timer to control breath rate via two valves: inhalation/exhalation valves. Later on we will add a step motor to drive a machanism to squeese a rubber bad/bottle in order to provide positive pressure.

## UI Options
Whoever is producing the Ventilator can opt to use either a LCD + 4 Buttons physical interface or an Android device connected via Bluetooth-LE (according to their budged and components availability). Both option can also coexist fine.

## UI Initial concept/proposal

### LCD/Buttons Interface
VentSim simulates the LCD and buttons. The LCD displays the following rows:

![UI](Docs/Ventilator_UI_sample.png)

Where the rows represent the following tokes:

 * **First**: Status (Idle, Alarm/Error or Running). BLE indicates:
   * X: Bluetooth is not installed
   * A: Bluettooth is disabled
   * A: Bluettooth is advertising
   * C: Bluettooth is connected.

 * **Second** row shows in real time the inhalation/exhalation progress.

 * **The other** rows are scrollable and show parameters. The operator can change the parameter values by pressing the Function button. The selected row starts flashing indicating that the parameter can be changed; If Function button is pressed once again then the next row will be selected (flash); if the arrows buttons are pressed then it will increase/decrease the parameter value. The Enter button will commit the change. If Enter button is not pressed (and no other button so) then it will time out and the current parameter will not be changed.

### Android UI
TBD
