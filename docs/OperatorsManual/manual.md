## Section 1: General Description

PanVent TM (pronounced Pan Vent) is a small,light weight pandemic ventilator designed for
use on adult patients from pediatric to adult in size, 23 kg or greater. It is a time cycled,
 flow limited ventilator providing Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation(IMV). In this mode of
 ventilation, an adjustable respiratory rate and tidal volume are delivered to the patient.
 The patient is allowed to breathe spontaneously between the mandatory breaths with minimal
  work of breathing. A built-in PEEP/CPAPsystem can be set to provide expiratory positive
   pressure. The delivered oxygen gas composition is supplied by a gas source external to
 the ventilator and is adjustable to 65% or 100%, with oxygen as the driving source gas.
  The ventilator can accept and deliver oxygen compositions varying from 21% to 100%.

PanVent TM is an electronically controlled pneumatic ventilator. Electrical
power is not required for patient ventilation. PanVent TM has been specifically designed
for patient support during pandemic and non-critical care unit mechanical ventilation.
 It maybe used during intra and inter-hospital pandemic, in aircraft, on ambulances,
 in emergency rooms, MRI and other radiologysuites.in regular hospital settings as well
 as converted medical facilities such as convention centers and indoor stadiums.

### Unique Device Identification (UDI)

Pursuant to the U.S.FDA Unique Device Identification (UDI) Rule, each device must
bear a UDI code. The UDI for PanVent TM ventilator is located under the. "Serial Number:" labeling, in plaintext, on the back panel of the device. The UDI code consists of one Device
Identifier (DI) and potentially four Production Identifiers (PI).

Therefore, UDI=DI+PI. Production identifiers are required if the information appears on the product(box) label. The UDI on the product(box) label appears in both plaintext and
machine-readable format. The numbers in the parentheses indicate different parts
of the UDI, as applicable to the device:

(01) Device Identifier

(10) Batch/LotNumber

(11) Manufacturing/Production Date

(17)Expiration Date

(21)Serial Number

The format for Manufacturing/Production date and Expiration date within the UDI
code is: YYMMDD

* YY=tens and units of the year(e.g.2014=14)
* MM=number of the month(e.g. January=01)
* DD=number of the day(e.g. third day=03)
* e.g. January03,2014=140103

An example UDI for the PanVent TM ventilator is as follows:

![](./images/diagrams/example_machine_uid.png)

Device Identifier=00853678006009

Serial Number=A0000

The Device Identifier portion of the code may be entered into Access GUDID to
obtain information about the product.[http://accessgudid.nlm.nih.gov/](http://accessgudid.nlm.nih.gov/)

### Internal Patient SafetySystems

The ventilator has several internal safety systems. These systems insure patient safety in the event of ventilator malfunction.

#### High Pressure Release

The patient circuit peak pressure is adjustable using the Peak Inspiratory Pressure
control. This control can be set from 15 to 60 cmH2O. The factory preset value is 40
cmH2O. In addition to this software control, there is an internal safety pressure release valve. This
valve will automatically limit circuit pressure to approximately 3 cmH2O, regardless of the setting of
the Peak Inspiratory Pressure control.

#### Anti-Suffocation System

An internal safety system will allow the patient to breathe on his or her own in the event of  
ventilator malfunction. At approximately 32 cmH2O negative pressure an internal valve will open
allowing unimpeded ambient air to enter the patient circuit for the patient. This system is always
available to the patient, irrespective of control settings, including PEEP/CPAP.
 **Software implementation too? Gordon?**

#### Low Gas Supply Pressure Alarm – Dave/Gordon: confirm we do not have this

When ever the driving gas supply pressure drops below the safe operating pressure the visual alarm
indicator will illuminate and an internal pneumatic audible alarm will sound. This low pressure alarm
will occur when the source gas pressure drops below 30psi(200kPa).The alarm will continue to sound
until all pressure has been lost in the system or when pressure is re-established
to at least 35psi (250kPa).

![](./images/symbols/caution.png) **WARNING:** The Low Gas Supply Alarm will only activate for a very
short period of time if the gas supply abruptly ceases as can happen if the supply
gas becomes disconnected. Always insure that the supply gas is secure and
operating at the proper pressure.**??**

#### Disconnect Alarm

The ventilator automatically monitors patient pressure at all times. If there is a disconnection in the
patient circuit the visual alarm indicator will illuminate and the audible alarm will sound. The alarm
activates when either of the following conditions occur:

|Mandatory Breaths Status| Alarm Behavior|
|--|--|
|ON| if a circuit pressure of at least 15 cmH2O is not sensed within 22 seconds after the last breath – Gordon, confirm or modify|
|OFF | if the circuit pressure is less than 5 cmH2O for  22 seconds. Gordon, confirm or modify|

**The Disconnect alarm may be silenced for 1 minute by pressing the alarm Reset/Silence button.**

**NOTE:** Always use an external oxygen monitor to insure the desired oxygen percentage is delivered to
the patient.

## Section 4: Operating Instructions Ventilator Set-up

### Operational Verification

| VerificationStep | AcceptableRange | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Attach a spirometer to the expiratory valve using the elbow included in the circuit packaging outlet port. After 3 breaths measure the delivered tidal volume. | 4700±470ml | Pass/Fail |
| Count the respiratory rate with a stopwatch. Measure the number of breaths in one minute. | 12±2 breaths per minute | Pass/Fail |
|Remove the test lung and occlude the patient connection on the circuit. Read the circuit pressure from the pressure gauge electronic display on the front of the ventilator. | 450 ±5 cmH2O | Pass/Fail |
|Remove the occlusion and allow the breathing circuit to remain open. Using astop watch, measure the time until the alarm sounds | 22±3seconds | Pass/Fail |
| With breathing circuit remaining open, check that airway pressure reads 0 cm H2O | 0 ±1 cmH2O | Pass/Fail |
| With breathing circuit remaining open, check that flowmeter reads 0 L/min | 0 ±1 L/min | Pass/Fail |

If the ventilator has passed all the above steps it is ready
to return to clinical use. If the ventilator fails to pass any of the following tests do not apply it
to patients. Call your local distributor or Airon Corporation Customer Support at 888-448-
1238(toll free USA & Canada)or+1-321-821- 9433. Discard the unit. **Do not attempt to service the unit.**

![](./images/symbols/caution.png) **CAUTION:** Do not disassemble the PanVent TM Ventilator. No
internal user replaceable parts. All service must be performed by Airon Corporation or an approved
service technician.

**Opening the device will negate the warranty. User will be responsible for all repair costs to service the unit.**

### Patient Ventilation

The ventilator operates with the following modes:

* CMV-Continuous Mechanical Ventilation
* Assist Control

Using the Continuous Mechanical Ventilation (CMV) mode, the ventilator provides an adjustable number of
breaths per minute. The tidal volume of these breaths is also adjustable. The patient may breathe
spontaneously between ventilator breaths as desired.

1.	Set the % Oxygen control to the desired FIO2 on the external blender or gas supply
1.	Set the PanVent On switch to On.
1.	Set the Tidal Volume control to the appropriate level by adjusting the pressure regulator – continue manual adjustment until the ensuing exhaled tidal volume displayed in ml on the user interface is within 10% of desired tidal volume
1.	Adjust the Respiratory Rate control to achieve the desired mandatory breath frequency.
1.	Adjust the Peak Inspiratory Pressure control to the desired level by turning the control while occluding the patient circuit and observing the level of pressure generated during a mandatory breath.
1.	Attach the patient circuit to the patient and observe for appropriate ventilation. Adjust as required. External measurement devices should be used to verify ventilation parameters.
1.	Adjust the PEEP control to the desired level.
1.	Adjust for spontaneous breath trigger sensitivity for assist control by the ventilator.
1.	Observe and monitor the patient and the ventilator per your institution's standards. If using a portable gas supply, monitor the supply level to insure there is sufficient gas for ventilation.


### Interrelationship of Volume and Rate Controls

There is an interrelationship between the Tidal Volume control and the Respiratory Rate control which
must be considered while operating this ventilator. The Tidal Volume control is a calibrated control
and will not vary from its setting during normal operation. It will not change if the Respiratory Rate
control is changed. The Respiratory Rate control is calibrated and will not vary
the patient's mandatory breath rate unless changed. However, if the Tidal Volume control setting is
changed the actual respiratory rate may change even if the Respiratory Rate control is not moved.

The ventilator operational characteristics define the reason the rate changes when the tidal volume is
changed. See Section 7 for a detailed description of the ventilator's Theory of Operation.

The Respiratory Rate control is calibrated for tidal volumes between 500 to 900ml. This allows the rate control to be preset with initial set-up of the ventilator on a patient.

Always count the patient's mandatory breath rate when first setting up the ventilator and after any
changes to the tidal volume to assure the patient is receiving the proper respiratory rate.

The mandatory breath inspiratory flow is fixed at 36L/min. Due to this preset flowrate, it is possible
that desired combinations of high tidal volume and respiratory rates may not be available. In
other words, combinations of high tidal volumes and high mandatory breath rates are limited by the
fixed mandatory breath flowrate. If a high respiratory rate is required, a lower tidal
volume may be necessary. Likewise, if a hightidal volume is required, a lower respiratory rate may be needed.



### Oxygen Control
The PanVent ventilator uses the gas mixture delivered to its gas inlet port. See Section 7 for a complete description of these systems. It is recommended that an external oxygen analyzer always be used to verify oxygen delivery.

### Hypobaric Operation

The ventilator will operate normally at altitudes up to 15,000 feet. Changes in altitude will not affect pressure settings. However, delivered tidal volume increases and respiratory rate decreases with increasing altitude. This is due to lower barometric pressure than ventilator calibration at standard sea level.

To compensate for the effect of changing altitude on tidal volume and respiratory rate, use an external spirometer to verify tidal volume accuracy. Adjust the Tidal Volume and Respiratory Rate controls to the desired value as measured by the spirometer rather than the markings on the control panel.

### Disconnect Alarm

The ventilator has a patient circuit disconnect alarm system. This system cannot be turned off. If a circuit disconnect is sensed, the visual indicator on the front panel will illuminate and the audible alarm will sound.

The alarm will activate as soon as an oxygen source is turned on to the ventilator. You may silence the alarm for 1 minute by pressing the Reset / Silence button. Attaching the ventilator to a patient and starting ventilation will automatically reset the alarm system and turn off the audible and visual indicators.

A patient circuit disconnect is sensed when any of the following conditions occur:
*	Mandatory Breaths “ON” – circuit pressure does not rise above 15 cm H2O within 22 seconds of the last time at least 15 cm H2O was sensed.
*	Mandatory Breaths “OFF” – a pressure of less than 5 cm H2O is sensed for 22 seconds

The alarm system can be momentarily silenced by pressing the Reset / Silence button on the front panel. Pressing this button turns off the visual and audible indicators for 1 minute. Each time the Reset / Silence button is pressed, the alarm system restarts the 1 minute silence time delay. This delay is NOT cumulative. In other words, repeatedly pressing the Reset / Silence button will not increase the silence time by more than 1 minute.


## Section 5: Patient Circuit Adult / Pediatric Circuit
### Adult Circuit
![](./images/diagrams/adult_circuit.png)

The patient circuit designed for use with the PanVent TM Model A is part number 58001, 6 ft. disposable patient circuit. The compression volume is 1ml per cm H2O.

![](./images/symbols/caution.png) **WARNING:** Patient circuits other than the circuits listed above
may alter the ventilator's PEEP characteristics and / or expiratory flow resistance. They should NOT be
used and may lead to patient harm.

![](./images/symbols/caution.png) **WARNING:** Air filters on the expiratory port of the patient
 circuit may alter the ventilator's PEEP characteristics and / or expiratory flow resistance. If the
  filter increases the flow resistance of the exhalation limb past 5 cm H2O/L/min, it should NOT be
   used and may lead to patient harm.

![](./images/symbols/caution.png) **CAUTION:** The PanVent TM ventilator requires the use of a cuffed
 endotracheal tube for proper device operation.

#### VentilatorConnection

The patient circuit must be attached to the ventilator properly. Incorrect attachment could result in
 failure to provide adequate ventilation.

![](./images/diagrams/patient_connection.png) The main breathing hose (22 mm) is connected to the “Patient Connection” port


![](./images/diagrams/exp_valve.png) The small tubing (3 mm) connects the expiratory valve to the “Expiratory Valve” port

**NOTE:** The patient circuit is a single use, disposable device. Cleaning, reprocessing and / or reuse of this device is not recommended. The circuit and all components are sold clean and non-sterile.

## Single-Use only Medical Devices/Accessories

### How do I know if a device is Single-Use?

![](./images/symbols/do_not_reuse.png)
This symbol will be identified on the packaging and User’s Manual of the device.

### What does Single-Use mean?

Do not reuse. A single-use device is used on an individual patient during a procedure, such as pandemic
 ventilation, and then discarded. It is not intended to be reprocessed and used again, even on the same
  patient.

### What is the concern with reused device labeled Single- Use?
The use of reprocessed devices may present serious incidents relating to the health and safety of patients and healthcare professionals. Reuse can be unsafe because of risk of:

*	Cross-infection – inability to clean and decontaminate due to design, device components are not manufactured for disassembly and reassembly, especially for the SARS-CoV-2 virus

*	Endotoxin reaction – excessive bacterial breakdown products, which cannot be adequately removed by cleaning

*	Patient injury – device failure from reprocessing or reuse because of fatigue or material alteration

*	Chemical burns or sensitization – residues from chemical decontamination agents on materials that can absorb chemicals


![](./images/symbols/caution.png) **NOTE:** If you reuse a single-use device you may be legally liable for the safe performance of the device.

## Section 7: Theory of Operation

PanVent TM is a pneumatic ventilator based upon the Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (IMV) principle. As such, adjustable respiratory rate and tidal volume breaths are delivered to the patient between which the patient may breathe spontaneously. This section describes how the ventilator operates.

Further information on the ventilator's theory of operation, including circuit diagrams, parts lists, and calibration instructions are available from CSSALT to properly trained service personnel.

### Pneumatic System

![](./images/diagrams/pneumatic_system_diagram.png)

#### Pneumatic System Description

The major components of the pneumatic system and the control of gas flow through the ventilator are as follows:
1.	High pressure gas (oxygen) enters the ventilator and is filtered (5 micron) and reduced to a lower working pressure (35 psi - 240 kPa).
1.	The timing circuit uses two precision control valves to control inspiratory and expiratory time. These valves charge (or reduce) pressure to a pneumatic timing cartridge. This timing cartridge turns on or off the ventilator's main flow valve.
1.	The main flow valve controls gas flow from the internal regulator to the % Oxygen control, which in turn delivers it to the patient. The % Oxygen control setting determines whether flow goes directly     to the patient or through the high flow venturi. If gas is directed to the patient, a restrictive orifice limits the flow to a specific flow rate (36 L/min). If gas is directed to the high flow venturi, ambient  air is entrained to provide precisely the same flow to the patient, but at a reduced FIO2 (approximately 65%). The high flow venturi provides stable performance (no stall) up to the maximum operating pressure (75 cm H2O) of the ventilator.
1.	The pressure generated by the main flow valve also powers the Peak Pressure control system. This system sends an adjustable pressure to the patient circuit expiratory valve. The pressure in this system determines the peak pressure that can be generated in the patient circuit.
1.	The adjustable PEEP / CPAP system directs a pressure signal to the expiratory valve to generate PEEP and provides flow on demand for spontaneous breaths.


#### Tidal Volume and Rate Control System

PanVent TM’s Tidal Volume and Respiratory Rate controls function to determine mandatory breath inspiratory and expiratory time.

Since the ventilator provides a fixed flow (at 36 L/min or 600 ml/sec) during a mandatory breath, setting a specific inspiratory time also sets a specific tidal volume. This tidal volume is so precise that the inspiratory time control is calibrated to reflect the range of tidal volumes available (360 to 1,500 ml).

The ventilator's tidal volume output will not change in the face of increasing patient circuit pressure. The only change that may occur to actual patient delivered tidal volume will be caused by compression of gas based upon the compliance of the patient circuit used. The compression volume of the ventilator itself is negligible.

The Respiratory Rate control adjusts expiratory time with a range 0.6 to 20 seconds. Rate is controlled by increasing or decreasing expiratory time. With a set tidal volume a slower respiratory rate will equate to a longer expiratory time. Tidal volume is not affected by changes to the Respiratory Rate control.

The Respiratory Rate control is calibrated for set tidal volumes between 500 and 900 ml. The calibrated

Respiratory Rate range optimizes the interdependence between the expiratory and inspiratory time for
 ease of operation. If the tidal volume is changed and the rate is not changed, the number of breaths
 that can occur in one minute changes.

For example:

    Volume=600,RespiratoryRate=12
      (I time=1sec, E time = 4 sec, total time = 5 sec)
    Change the volume to 900
      (I time changes to 1.5 sec)
    Resultant Respiratory Rate is now 11
      (total time for inspiration and expiration = 5.5 sec)

    Volume = 600, Respiratory Rate = 12
      (I time = 1 sec, E time=4sec, total time = 5 sec)
    Change the volume to 1200
      (I time changes to 2 sec)
    Resultant Respiratory Rate is now 10
      (total time for inspiration and expiration = 6 sec)

Tidal volumes below 500 ml will result in faster rates than marked on the Respiratory Rate control.
Tidal volumes higher than 900 ml will result in slower rates than marked on the Respiratory Rate
control. The marks on the Rate Control are wide to reflect the range of control position that will
provide the desired rate over the range of tidal volume. Always count the respiratory rate when first
placing the ventilator on a patient and whenever changing tidal volumes.

As when using any mechanical ventilator, careful attention to detail is required. It is suggested that
independent validation of tidal volume and rate be performed using external spirometers and timing
devices.

### Mandatory Breath Pressure Control System

During normal mandatory breath inspiration the expiratory valve functions to prevent gas from escaping through the expiratory valve. The pressure used to close the expiratory valve is set with the Peak Pressure control. The range is 15 to 75 cm H2O.

The Peak Pressure adjustment can be used to manipulate the highest pressure applied during mandatory breaths.
*	If volume limited ventilation is the goal, set the Tidal Volume control to the desired volume and the Peak Pressure control to at least 10 cm H2O above the pressure required to deliver that tidal volume.
*	If pressure limited ventilation is the goal, set the Tidal Volume control to the desired inspiratory time and the Peak Pressure control to the desired peak pressure.
During pressure limited ventilation any excess flow will be released by the expiratory valve while maintaining the desired peak pressure. This flow release may cause a "honking" sound as gas escapes through the partially closed valve.

The Peak Pressure control can be tested by occluding the patient port of the patient circuit during a mandatory breath. During the breath the pressure will rapidly rise to the set peak pressure. Turn the Peak Pressure control until the desired peak pressure is achieved.

### CPAP Demand Flow Breathing System

The ventilator's internal CPAP demand flow system provides gas for spontaneous breathing at adjustable
CPAP pressures up to 20 cm H2O. This system has several key features:

1.	When turned on, the system supplies a continuous flow of gas at approximately 10 L/min during the expiratory time of the ventilator. This flow of gas helps to establish the desired CPAP level by balancing flow with the pressure generated on the expiratory valve by the CPAP system.
1.	The continuous flow of gas also establishes the flow sensitivity to spontaneous breathing efforts. If the patient's inspiratory flow demand exceeds the continuous flow of gas, additional flow will be added to meet patient demand. There is no sensitivity adjustment to this system. The CPAP system will automatically meet the needs of the patient, greater than 100 L/min, by attempting to maintain the balance between flow and pressure at the expiratory valve.
1.	The PEEP control was evaluated to the dynamics of XXXX disposable patient circuit. Using this circuit will insure proper operation and the full 0 to 20 cm H2O PEEP range.

### Oxygen Delivery System

With the ventilator driven by 100% oxygen as the source gas, the ventilator can be set to deliver 65% or 100% oxygen. There are two independent systems within the ventilator that determine oxygen concentration. The following section describes how these systems operate.

#### Mandatory Breaths

The % Oxygen control determines the oxygen concentration of the mandatory breaths that enter the patient circuit at the Patient Connection. When set for 65%, an internal high flow venturi system entrains ambient air to decrease the FIO2 while maintaining the correct tidal volume. The high flow venturi provides stable performance up to the maximum operating pressure (75 cm H2O) of the ventilator.

#### Spontaneous Breaths

Spontaneous breaths are available from the internal CPAP system which uses a venturi mechanism separate from the mandatory breath high flow venturi. When turned on by the PEEP / CPAP control, the system delivers approximately 10 L/min baseline flow during the expiratory time of the ventilator.

The FIO2 of this system is set by the % Oxygen control. When set for 65%, the actual oxygen percentage
and baseline flow is related to the level of CPAP in use. Up to 10 cm H2O CPAP will provide a FIO2 of
approximately 0.65 +/- 0.10. As the CPAP level raises to 20 cm H2O, the FIO2 can be expected to
increase to as high as 0.75 +/- 0.10.This is due to a drop off in efficiency (stalling) of the CPAP
venturi system at higher CPAP levels. The actual FIO2 of spontaneous breaths will be approximately the
same as the baseline flow. Whether set for 65% or 100%, extremely high inspiratory flow demand may
decrease the desired FIO2.


*It is recommended that an external oxygen monitor be used at all times to measure and display the delivered oxygen concentration.*

![](./images/symbols/caution.png) **WARNING:** Never operate the ventilator without proper oxygen gas supply at the required pressure.

#### Factors Effecting the Operating Time of Oxygen Tanks
There are several factors that affect the length of time the ventilator will operate from a tank of oxygen. The ventilator uses very little gas for its own operation (less than 4 L/min) and is not a major factor in oxygen tank consumption. The major factors are:

* Volume of oxygen in the tank
* Patient's tidal volume and rate
* Position of the % Oxygen control
* If the PEEP/CPAP system is on or off

Setting the % Oxygen control to 65% will decrease the amount of oxygen used from the tank, nearly doubling the time an oxygen tank lasts.

**NOTE:** Always use full oxygen and air tanks before the start of any pandemic. The calculation of any
expected run time becomes unreliable as tank pressure is reduced.

#### Example of expected operating time using a full "E" size cylinder (660 liters) PEEP/CPAP off

|Minute Volume|100% Oxygen|65%Oxygen|
| -- | -- | -- |
|5 l/m | 77 min | 80 min |
|10l/m | 40min | 76min |
|15 l/m | 33min | 60min |

The PEEP / CPAP system, when turned on, uses approximately 5 L/min oxygen from the tank to provide the 10 L/min baseline flow of the system. The patient's own spontaneous tidal volume and rate will use additional oxygen from the tank, based upon the tidal volume of those breaths.

#### Example of expected operating time using a full "E" size cylinder (660 liters) PEEP/CPAP on

| Minute Volume | 100% Oxygen | 65% Oxygen |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5l/m | 29min | 37min |
| 10l/m | 26min | 33min |
| 15l/m | 23min | 30min |

used. In addition, safe MRI practice calls for all devices used in the proximity of a MRI scanner be anchored to prevent inadvertent movement.


### MRI Compatibility

The ventilator was engineered and built to be MRI compatible. Testing in a MRI scanner has shown
that the scanner does not affect the ventilator's performance. The ventilator does not generate artifact, RF noise, or other deleterious effects on the operation of the MRI scanner or it's production
of an image. In addition, due to PanVent TM Ventilator components, heating of the ventilator does not
occur during scanning.

Testing for MRI compatibility was done following ASTM MRI safetystandards F2052–06e1 and F2119–07. The
MRI scanner used has the following maximum performance levels:

* Static field strength-3Tesla
* Spatial field gradient-720G/cm

The scanner used for testing was an active shielded system. The ventilator was placed in the position
of maximum field strength and maximum spatial gradient. The standard patient
circuit(Aironpartnumber58031) was used. A standard imaging sequence with a maximum scanning time of 5
minutes was used.


**TODO: Retrieve image**:w
The PanVent TM Ventilator meets testing requirements for use within the Magnetic Resonance Environment
with a conditional marking for safety.

**NOTE:** Airon recommends that users perform the above referenced tests in their MRI scanner prior to
patient use.

![](./images/symbols/caution.png) **WARNING:** While tests show that the ventilator functions at the
bore of the MRI unit, Airon Corporation does not recommend that the ventilator be clinically used at or
with in the bore of MRI scanners. A minimum proximity of 12 inches(0.3meter) from the bore should be
used. In addition, safe MRI practice calls for all devices used in the proximity of a MRI scanner be
anchored to prevent in advertent movement.

### Disconnect Alarm

The ventilator has an internal patient circuit disconnect alarm system. This system cannot be turned off. If a circuit disconnect is sensed, the visual indicator on the front panel will illuminate and the audible alarm will sound.

The alarm will activate as soon as an oxygen source is turned on to the ventilator. Attaching the ventilator to a patient and starting ventilation will automatically reset the alarm system and turn off the audible and visual indicators

The alarm system can be momentarily silenced by pressing the Reset / Silence button on the front panel. Pressing this button turns off the visual and audible indicators for 1 minute. Each time the Reset / Silence button is pressed, the alarm system restarts the 1 minute silence time delay. This delay is NOT cumulative. In other words, repeatably pressing the Reset / Silence button will not increase the silence time by more than 1 minute.

The alarm system is entirely pneumatic and uses no electricity. A series of valves and pneumatic capacitances provide the sensing network. Two subsystems are used, one for when Mandatory Breaths are turned on and another for when Mandatory Breaths are turned off. This allows  the alarm to operate when only CPAP is functioning. Due  to the nature of this system, a minimum CPAP of 5 cm  H2O is required. If CPAP is set for less than 5 cm H2O and Mandatory Breaths are not turned on, the alarm system will activate.

The alarm system provides a passive, non-electrically charged remote alarm output on the rear of the ventilator.

### Low Gas Supply Alarm

The Low Gas Supply Alarm will occur if the driving gas supply drops below safe levels (30 psi, 200 kPa). The alarm activates as long as driving gas is available or until the supply pressure returns to normal.

When operating from an oxygen cylinder the ventilator will gradually use up the gas in the cylinder and tank pressure will fall. Once the cylinder pressure reaches approximately 500 psi, most portable tank regulators will start to decrease pressure to the ventilator during mandatory breaths. As this happens that Low Gas Supply Alarm will sense the decreased pressure and begin to intermittently alarm each time the pressure drops during inspiration. As pressure in the cylinder falls to lower values, the amount of time the regulator is delivering low pressure increases and the alarm sounds longer. Eventually the regulator is unable to maintain pressure and the alarm will sound continuously until all gas in the cylinder is used.

![](./images/symbols/caution.png) **WARNING:** The Low Gas Supply Alarm will only activate for a very
short period of time if the gas supply abruptly ceases. This can occur if operating from a wall source
and the gas supply hose is disconnected from the gas supply outlet. In fact, the Low Gas Supply Alarm
may not sound at all when the ventilator is disconnected from a wall source. This is because all gas in
the high pressure hose immediately exits out from where the hose was connected to the outlet and there
is no gas pressure to power the ventilator’s alarm. When using the ventilator on a patient always
insure that the supply gas is secure and operating at the proper pressure.
