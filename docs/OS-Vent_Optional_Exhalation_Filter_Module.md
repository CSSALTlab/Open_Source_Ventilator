The exhalation valve is closed when inspiration occurs so that gas from the inspiration module flows to the patient&#39;s lungs. The exhalation valve opens to allow the patient to exhale.

| **Physical Input** | **Data/Control Input** | **Physical Output** | **Status** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Design A (balloon exhalation valve with solenoid-activated pilot valve)**
Exhaled gas from patient | Time exhalation valve should be open Time exhalation should be closed | Exhaled gas from patient Inlet and outlet to exhalation module must accept 22 mm corrugated hose used in breathing circuit When open, resistance to flow through exhalation valve must be low (≤ 3 cm H2O/l/s) | Not claimed; No one working on it yet |
|
| **Design B (exhalation valve with solenoid-activated gate or disc)**
Exhaled gas from patient | Time exhalation valve should be open Time exhalation should be closed | Exhaled gas from patient Inlet and outlet to exhalation module must accept 22 mm corrugated hose used in breathing circuit When open, resistance to flow through exhalation valve must be low (≤ 3 cm H2O/l/s) | Not claimed; No one working on it yet |
