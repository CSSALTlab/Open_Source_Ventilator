The inspiration module delivers gas to the patient during the inspiratory time Ti. The inspiration valve closes during exhalation.

| **Physical Input** | **Data/Control Input** | **Physical Output** | **Status** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Design A (100% O2)** Oxygen at 50 ± 5 psig (345± 35 kPa) | Time inspiration should be on Time inspiration should be off | O2 flows towards patient at a given flow rate during the selected inspiratory time to deliver the desired tidal volume In a constant flow inspiration, the flow rate is VT/Ti l/s | Not claimed; No one working on it yet |
|
| **Design B (21%-100% O2)** Oxygen at 50 ± 5 psig (345± 35 kPa)Air at 50 ± 5 psig (345± 35 kPa) | FiO2 level selected by user Time inspiration should be on Time inspiration should be off | Gas at desired FiO2 flows towards patient at a given flow rate during the selected inspiratory time to deliver the desired tidal volume In a constant flow inspiration, the flow rate is VT/Ti l/s |
