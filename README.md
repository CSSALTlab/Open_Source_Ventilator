Open source for use worldwide and contributions from others worldwide

See out documentation at [https://cssaltlab.github.io/Open_Source_Ventilator/](https://cssaltlab.github.io/Open_Source_Ventilator/)

NOTE:
The ventilator makes references to 2 outside libraries not included in the code found on the Github or in the Arduino IDE.


These two libraries are:  

    AllSensors_DLHR (https://github.com/jeremycole/AllSensors_DLHR)
    BMP280 sensor library (https://itbrainpower.net/downloadables/sSense-BMx280.zip)

To add these two libraries to your Arduino IDE:

    Open your Arduino IDE
    Select "Sketch"->"Include Library"->"Add .ZIP library..."
    Navigate to the location of the .zip of the library you downloaded from the websites listed above

Do this for each of the two libraries needed.
