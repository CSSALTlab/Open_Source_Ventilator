# Controller

There are two codebases for the controller. The first, under OSVent folder, UF is currently using it for testing and pontentially for initial design proposal as well. The second, under ControllerSourceCode folder, provides more abstraction for new features and support for other hardware boards. Note, however, that the latest ControllerSourceCode has been developed and maintained in the following GitHub:

The ControllerSourceCode folder in here does not have the latest updates.

The prime contact for ControllerSourceCode is [mv_email@yahoo.com](mailto:mv_email@yahoo.com)
