Design A (Water Column):  
Pros:
1. Easiest to calibrate & adjust due to ease of hydrostatic pressure generation via a water column.

Cons:
1. Creating an air-water column interface without leaks using austere materials will be challenging.

Possible Pathways (PEEP_H2O-Concept.png):
1. Using a 3 way "T" type configuration, with the 3 ways being: 
  1) the 22mm corrugated tubing carrying the exhaled gas
  2) the conditionally blocked route to the atmosphere (default: closed)
  3) the inlet for the water column to control access to #2
  
  The challenge is to have a shuttle/bead/piston which can slide within the "T" conditionally putting #'s 1 & 2 into contact
  while able to form a seal between #1 & #2, without allowing the water to leak between #2 & #3.  Such a shuttle would not likely
  be able to be placed into the T unless it was elastic or unless it was a T with differening inlets (e.g. 1" #1, >1" #2 & #3).
  One solution to the water control issue would be to use either a condom (doubtful that they come in 30 cm lengths),
  sausage casing, dialysis tubing (too leaky likely), or other long, but flexible tube which could contain the water, 
  fit within the hardware and be the water column-fueled "spring" to keep the shuttle/ball/piston in the closed position until 
  P > water column height is achieved.  I think that this is akin to a sleeve diaphragm, but cobbled together with non-purpose
  bulit materials.

2.  Similar to Pathway 1, but cast a silicone diaphragm or bellows like structure.  Wound need a custom interface to fit within
the T and enable a male connector into the diaphragm/bellows with a male tubing adapter on the water column side.  Can benefit
from less water needed (pressure is based solely on column height, not fluid volume.  Adjusting can be based on moving a filled
and bent tube up and down vs. add/remove water.

3. Either pathway 1 or 2, with the condom/diaphragm alone without the shuttle as both the seal between #1 and #2 and the 
containment for the water column.

Design B (Spring Loaded Valve aka Check Valve with Adjustable Break Pressure)

Basically, just a custom made check valve with a screw-based tension adjustment to increase or decrease the cracking/break
pressure.  Easiest to make, easiest to adjust, but less calibrated (adjustments would be somewhat calibrated to begin with, but
would then devolve to more vs. less pressure.
